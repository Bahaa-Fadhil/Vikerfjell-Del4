# Vikerfjell-(Back-end)

The thesis is based on a development method called an iterative development or an incremental system development. The solution is developed step by step, and each increment increases the operational function of the application. The application is expected to meet todayâ€™s requirements for universal design.

The task was to create a web application for Vikerfjell, We could not use any kind of framework, library or CMS systems. The application should have the ability to change all of the content, and we had to use the following programming languages: PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, MYSQL.
